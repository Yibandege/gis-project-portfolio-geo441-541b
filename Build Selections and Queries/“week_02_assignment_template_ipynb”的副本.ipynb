A Feature Dataset is a collection within the geodatabase that groups related Feature Classes. Feature datasets ensure that all feature classes share the same spatial reference system, which helps maintain consistency in spatial analysis. Feature Classes are the individual data layers within the feature dataset, representing different geographic features (points, lines, polygons). This hierarchical structure promotes efficient organization, data management, and complex spatial relationships in GIS projects.\n"
